# Welcome to Lotide

This is Lotide, a library of basic Javascript functions. It is based on Lodash.

I made this to practice publishing packages to NPM. It is **not** intended for production use. 

As such, I'm not planning to write proper documentation for the functions in this library. 
If for some really odd reason, you want to use this code, open a bug in:

https://github.com/sherwin-kwan/lotide/issues

and I'll give you a rundown.

This is open-source software made available as-is with no warranty whatsoever, see the LICENSE file for more info.
